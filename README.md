Hi Mr. Johnston,
I'd like to learn more about deploying models after you build them. What if you build a recommendation engine for the website and the website is deployed in the cloud? What about if I have a sales forecast model and I need it to update daily to provide day-ahead forecasting? These are some of the things I'd like to learn more about. Also, if there are any good books where I can read more about it.
